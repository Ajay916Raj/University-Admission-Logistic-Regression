# University-Admission-Logistic-Regression
Created a Logistic Regression Model where we aim to predict the accpetance of individuals using their SAT scores and gender.
The initial model was created with statsmodels and the summary and the model was interpreted.
Finally ran a 90-10 split test and interpreted the results.
